# Color Mixer Embedded System

### This is a project to demonstrate low level programming and hardware skills.

This repo contains C code that interfaces to an Arduino, along with various hardware pieces, such as potentiometer, an 8-bit shift register, a 2-to-4 decoder, an LED display, a tri-color LED, and more.


This project provides an interface on the LED display, where a user may select what color they'd like to have displayed. It also allows users to dim or brighten the light using the potentiometer. A color may also be "fully turned on" and mixed with other colors (see demo video). This is achieved using the Arduino's analog-to-digital capabilities and hardware interrupts.

See the schematic and demo video below ;)
